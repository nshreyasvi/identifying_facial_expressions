## FER based emotion recognition
The major objective of this study was to identify in case if indifferent emotion is detected in examination videos or not. Based on the results, in some cases, it is not the most dominant emotion throughout the videos.

In order to carry out the same [FER](https://pypi.org/project/fer/) was used.
The results in the end are shown as follows:
- Neutral facial emotion dominant across the video ![plot](https://github.com/nshreyasvi/identifying_facial_expressions/blob/main/mean_plots/Nathalie_Cligne_Yeux_mean.png)
